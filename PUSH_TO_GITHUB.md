# Push to GitHub Instructions

## After creating the repository on GitHub, run these commands:

```powershell
# Add the remote repository (replace with your actual GitHub username if different)
git remote add origin https://github.com/emailmdharoon-collab/TradeApp-Auggie.git

# Verify the remote was added
git remote -v

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## If you encounter authentication issues:

You may need to use a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of your password.

1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Generate a new token with 'repo' scope
3. Use the token as your password when prompted

## Alternative: Use SSH (Recommended for frequent pushes)

```powershell
# If you prefer SSH, use this remote URL instead:
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:emailmdharoon-collab/TradeApp-Auggie.git

# Then push
git push -u origin main
```

## Verify the push was successful:

After pushing, visit: https://github.com/emailmdharoon-collab/TradeApp-Auggie

You should see all your files there!
