# GitHub Enhancements Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Added

### 1. GitHub Actions CI/CD Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

A comprehensive continuous integration workflow that runs automatically on every push and pull request.

#### Workflow Features:

**Build Job:**
- ‚úÖ Tests on Python 3.11 and 3.12 (matrix testing)
- ‚úÖ Caches pip dependencies for faster builds
- ‚úÖ Installs all project dependencies
- ‚úÖ Lints code with flake8 (checks for syntax errors)
- ‚úÖ Compiles Python files to check for syntax errors
- ‚úÖ Tests core imports (streamlit, pandas, numpy)
- ‚úÖ Runs pytest tests (if available)

**Code Quality Job:**
- ‚úÖ Checks code formatting with Black
- ‚úÖ Security vulnerability scanning with Safety
- ‚úÖ Runs on Python 3.12

#### When It Runs:
- On push to `main` or `develop` branches
- On pull requests to `main` or `develop` branches

#### What It Does:
1. **Syntax Checking:** Ensures no Python syntax errors
2. **Dependency Validation:** Confirms all dependencies install correctly
3. **Import Testing:** Verifies core libraries can be imported
4. **Code Quality:** Checks formatting and security issues
5. **Test Execution:** Runs unit tests (when available)
